# Position and Accelerometer

**Manipulating The Z Position:**  In this program I wanted to make the CPX to not have any light when upright but light up when flipped upside down. So I knew I need to make a program which could detect if it was facing up or down. So I got to work on setting a variable for the Z acceleration, I named it Position Z. I also found that -1023 mg represented that the CPX was facing upwards and that the range of these accelerations for X, Y, or Z is -1023 mg to 1023 mg. Next I put an (Conditional) If, Then logic section into my forever loop and in the ‘True’ section I replaced it with a comparison logic. I placed my Position Z variable on the left side of the comparison and then I made the symbol greater than, and after troubleshooting some the number I put was 600 on the right side. This number makes it so that right around the halfway mark of flipping the CPX, what the CPX does changes. Next under the If I put a random pattern of lights I wanted the CPX to light up with when facing downwards and then I placed a set all pixels black under the else portion. Picture Ex:

**Manipulating The Z and X Position,** **Program 2:** In this program I wanted to make to manipulate two positions at once, to see how the CPX responds to detecting and executing tasks for two positions. Similarly to last time I knew I need to make a program which could detect if it was facing up or down but this time I wanted it to also detect left and right. So I set a variable for the Z acceleration and X acceleration and named them Position Z and X respectively. Same as last time I put an (Conditional) If, Then logic section into my forever loop and in the ‘True’ section I replaced it with a comparison logic. I placed my Position Z variable on the left side of the comparison and then I made the symbol greater than, and typed the number 600 on the right side. Next, again under the If I put a random pattern of lights I wanted the CPX to light up with when facing downwards and then I placed an other random light pattern, different from the last to differentiate, under the else portion. Then I pressed the plus symbol on the bottom left of the if, else logic, this button should create a new else if tab on the in between the tabs before. Now repeat the steps done for the Z position being placed on the new else, if section, instead now for the X position and add an other different light effect under it. The program should now make a different light effect when upright, upside down, or when being moved left or right. Picture Ex:

**Alternative to program 1, Program 3:** I attempted to make the code with a 'While' loop or just an 'If' logic instead of the 'If, Else' logic originally used and I couldn’t get it to work. The code in these instances made it so that the CPX checked if the conditions where met, and once they were met, stopped updating and checking if it were still true, instead of continuously like I wanted it to. So the next easiest alternative I came up with, and only alternative I came up with, was switching the 600 in the comparison to -600! This some how keeps it the same and does the same thing, i am not sure why. Picture Ex:
